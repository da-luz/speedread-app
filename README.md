# SpeedRead App

This is a half-lazy-made app that aims to encourage reading through reading sprints, timing the periods you spend reading

Initially it will only record each book reading sprint as a proof of concept; in the future there are plans to implement a ranking board and reading showdowns (reading competitions with your friends)

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). And this project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
